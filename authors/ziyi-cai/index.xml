Complexity Analysis. Introduce simple lower bound analysis and time space complexity for Turing machine. Proof, Verification and NP-hardness. A brief introduction of NP-hardness and some major topics in complexity theory. Presentations for Theoretical Computer Science, Spring 2021 This is a course project of Theoretical Computer Science, an introductory course for second year undergraduate students at ACM Honor Class, SJTU.</description></item><item><title>Gigantic Splight</title><link>https://ziyi-cai.site/projects/gigantic-splight/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 16:44:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ziyi-cai.site/projects/gigantic-splight/</guid><description>Fluid simulation has been a challenge in Computer Graphics domain. In this project we implemented Macklin and Müller’s algorithm specified in their paper Macklin and Müller 2013. To achieve real-timeness, we utilized Taichi framework to render the fluid in real time, which is proven to be robust and handy comparing to CUDA programming. We also raised several interactive ways to enhance its playability. In order to have a better realistic view, foam simulation is also added into our scene.</description></item><item><title>The Unconsoled</title><link>https://ziyi-cai.site/projects/the-unconsoled/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 12:37:08 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ziyi-cai.site/projects/the-unconsoled/</guid><description>This project is a model checking program for LTL formula assigned in CS3959 course. In accordance with the algorithm outlined in &amp;ldquo;Principles of Model Checking&amp;rdquo;, my program converts Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas into the corresponding nondeterministic Buchi automata, and performs a cross product operation with a given transition system. Subsequently, the program conducts a persistence checking process to validate the results.

We built a compiler from scratch, from the backend to the frontend (ANTLR 4 used for parsing) and added multiple optimizing strategies to reach the -O1 baseline. It was really an Odyssey both for mind and body.
The tutorial repo is here. And my code is here.
The bloated project structure looks like this:
src ├── Assembly │ ├── asmBlock.java │ ├── asmEntry.java │ ├── asmFunction.java │ ├── Instruction │ │ ├── brInst.</description></item><item><title>Foundation</title><link>https://ziyi-cai.site/projects/foundation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 16:20:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ziyi-cai.site/projects/foundation/</guid><description>This project is assigned in MS108 course. We implemented an emulated RISCV32I CPU in verilog. Our final code could be loaded into a FPGA board to run real RISC-V programs.
My design is based on Tomasulo algorithm with hardware-based speculation.

After several weeks of hard work, we were able to successfully complete the project and use it for the Programming course for juniors in the ACM Honor Class. The platform was eventually adopted by multiple courses at the university, including Programming, Data Structure, and Algorithms.
