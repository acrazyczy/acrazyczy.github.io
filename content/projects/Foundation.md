This project is assigned in MS108 course. We implemented an emulated RISCV32I CPU in verilog. Our final code could be loaded into a FPGA board to run real RISC-V programs.

My design is based on Tomasulo algorithm with hardware-based speculation.

The tutorial repo is [here](https://github.com/ACMClassCourses/MS108-2020). And my code is [here](https://github.com/acrazyczy/Foundation).
