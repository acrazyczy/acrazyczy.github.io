During my sophomore year, I initiated the development of an online program judging platform, running on https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/OnlineJudge/ with some of my classmates. After several weeks of hard work, we were able to successfully complete the project and use it for the Programming course for juniors in the ACM Honor Class. The platform was eventually adopted by multiple courses at the university, including Programming, Data Structure, and Algorithms.
