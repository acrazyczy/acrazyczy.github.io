This project is a model checking program for LTL formula assigned in CS3959 course. In accordance with the algorithm outlined in "*Principles of Model Checking*", my program converts Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas into the corresponding nondeterministic Buchi automata, and performs a cross product operation with a given transition system. Subsequently, the program conducts a persistence checking process to validate the results.

You can find my code [here](https://github.com/acrazyczy/the-unconsoled).
