## Lectures for *Great Ideas in Computer Science*, Fall 2022
* *Great Ideas in Computer Science* is a course for freshmen at ACM Honor Class, SJTU, where I served as a teaching assistant.
* [Complexity Analysis](/talks/complexity-analysis.pdf). Introduce simple lower bound analysis and time space complexity for Turing machine.
* [Proof, Verification and NP-hardness](/talks/proof-verification-np-hardness.pdf). A brief introduction of NP-hardness and some major topics in complexity theory.

## Presentations for *Theoretical Computer Science*, Spring 2021
* This is a course project of *Theoretical Computer Science*, an introductory course for second year undergraduate students at ACM Honor Class, SJTU.
* [The Reachability Problem for Petri Nets is Not Elementary](/talks/reachability-petri-nets-not-elementary.pdf). This is a presentation with [Lejun Min](https://aik2.site/) for the theoretical computer science course on Jun. 3, 2021. In this lecture, we introduce the latest results in [[Czerwiński, Lasota, Lazić, Leroux and Mazowiecki, 2019]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313276.3316369) on the lower bound for reachability of VAS.

## Miscellany
* [Resolution Size by Graph Based Parameters](/talks/resolution-size-by-graph-based-parameters.pdf).
